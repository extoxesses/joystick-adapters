### Pinout configuration
Wire  | Pin
------ | ---
Red    | 5V Vcc
Yellow | Ground
White  | Data
Green  | Clock
Black  | ???

> **Note:** In order to guarantee the correct current flow to the keyboard without heaving on the Arduino itself, I connect the keyboard Vcc wire to the Arduino `RAW` pin (directly connected to the USB). Eventually, I also bridged the J1 pin to be sure that al the board works at 5 volt.
